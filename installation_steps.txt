Installation Steps
-----------------

1. Create a directory "rasa_nlu" inside your preferred location. We will call this as workDir
      Example:-   workDir = /home/ubuntu/USERS/JENNY/CHAT/rasa_nlu

2.  Issue the below git clone command to pull the repository locally
      Command:- git clone https://github.com/RasaHQ/rasa_nlu.git
      
3.  This creates a directory rasa_nlu inside the existing directory and the path appears like below 
      /home/ubuntu/USERS/JENNY/CHAT/rasa_nlu/rasa_nlu

4.  execute the below command to install all the dependant modules
      pip install -r requirements.txt 
      pip install -e .
      
5. Create your project directory under the work directory. 
    Example:-  projDir = $workDir/PROJECT

6.  Inside this directory , create 3 directories 
      mkdir -p CONFIG TRAIN MODELS

7.  Go Inside CONFIG Folder , create a file called config.yml 
          This file holds the configuration of our understanding process ( pipeline ) 
          
8.  Paste the below parameters in the file 
          language: "en"
pipeline:
- name: "tokenizer_whitespace"
- name: "ner_crf"
- name: "ner_synonyms"
- name: "intent_featurizer_count_vectors"
- name: "ner_duckling_http"
  url: "http://localhost:8000"
  #dimensions: ["amount-of-money", "duration", "quantity", "time", "volume"]
- name: "intent_classifier_tensorflow_embedding"
intent_tokenization_flag: "true"
intent_split_symbol: "_"
epochs: "10"

9. Please note yml is a strict parser and might throw some errors if the spaces are not alligned. 
Please make it consistent to avoid such issues

10. Go Inside TRAIN Folder , create a file called nlu.md 
          This file will hold all the training data of your project. 
          
11. Go to Project directory and create a file called train.sh 
        This file will hold the commandline to initiate the training of models 
        
 12. Paste the below parameters in the file

currDir=$WorkDir/$projDir

python3 -m rasa_nlu.train -c $currDir/CONFIG/config.yml --data $currDir/TRAIN/nlu.md -o $folderName --fixed_model_name $currDir/MODELS --project $folderName --verbose

13. In the above Step number 8 , as per our need we have constructued the components of the pipeline. 
One such independant component is duckling . This library helps identifying the dimensions such as time , quantity etc. 

14. To install this componenet do the below steps 
        pip3 install duckling
 
15. In order to have the repository inside your working Directory, run the below commands
        wget -qO- https://get.haskellstack.org/ | sh

16.  This will bring the sources of duckling inside rasa_nlu 

17.  This has a virtual run time environment through docker 
      So , to execute this "docker run -p 8000:8000 rasa/duckling" 

18.   The config files of duckling related are given in the file rasa_duckling_config.txt. Please follow. 

19.  After having sufficient training data in nlu.md ,  When you run train.sh , 
      it trains your models and places them inside the folder $projDir/MODELS
      
20.   Test the data by placing a file with the below content.  

from rasa_nlu.model import Interpreter
import json

interpreter = Interpreter.load("./PROJECT/MODELS")

message = "how much did i spend for entertainment last month" ( This is the test statement ) 

result = interpreter.parse(message)

print(json.dumps(result, indent=2))

It gives the matched intent
